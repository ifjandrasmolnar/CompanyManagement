## Management Platform:

The management platform provides functionalities for handling various aspects of the company's operations:

### Employee and Admin Access Management:

This section allows the management of employees and admin access privileges.

### Order and Company Information Management:

This area enables the management and overview of company orders, job statuses, and other internal information.

### Contacts and Customer Management:

This section is dedicated to handling and managing customer contact details and communication.

The management section is currently under development, and while some functionalities are available, ongoing work continues to expand and improve its features.

We aim to develop a fully functional platform that will effectively serve our business needs.
